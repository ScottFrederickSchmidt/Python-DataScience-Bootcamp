This class was tons of information! 

I talked with my friend, Sukamar who has 5 years data science experience once I was almost done with this bootcamp..

I will be focusing on the Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, and Seaborn projects again in the future.
He said those were the most important sections of this course and one does not need to "memorize" everything.
In my next course, the Mega Python 10 Real Life Projects, it reviews Numpy and Pandas again which were the two most important.

Also, I will be reattempting some of these bootcamp projects and the Pandas optional project #2 in the near future.

I will post new code with any updates, but I am moving onto two other courses for now.

Feel free to contact me with any questions on this course:
