This class was tons of information! 

I talked with my friend, Sukamar who has 5 years data science experience.

I will be focusing on the Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, and Seaborn projects again in the future.
He said those were the most important sections of this course and one does not need to "memorize" everything.

Therefore, I will be reattempting those projects and doing the Pandas optional project #2 in the near future.

I will post any codes with updates, but I am moving onto two other courses for now!

Feel free to contact me with any questions on this course:
